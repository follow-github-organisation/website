repo_desc: "Optical Flow SDK exposes the latest hardware capability of Turing GPUs dedicated to computing the relative motion of pixels between images. The hardware uses sophisticated algorithms to yield highly accurate flow vectors, with robust frame-to-frame intensity variations and tracks the true object motion faster and more accurately."
